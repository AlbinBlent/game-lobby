# Game Lobby by Albin Blent!

To test locally you need to start both the frontend and the backend.
In order to do this you need to have node and yarn installed.

Do this by first:
	- cd game-lobby
	- yarn
	- yarn start

Then in a new terminal:
	- cd game-lobby-service
	- yarn
	- yarn start:dev
  
Now open your browser and checkout localhost:3000
